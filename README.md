## Self-hosting

If you wish to self-host AurAchieve for some reason, you'll have to clone the [backend](https://github.com/NiceSapien/AurAchieve-backend) repository aswell, written in ExpressJS. The instructions to setup the backend are present in the repository readme.

To setup the frontend:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install flutter and download packages

```bash
pub get && flutter pub get
```

3. Edit lib/api_service.dart with your own backend URL. Do **not** use our API link!

4. Update lib/main.dart with you own appwrite project. Do **not** use our project ID!

5. Setup firebase if you want push notifications and upload your `google-services.json` in `android/app` and `GoogleService-Info.plist` in `ios/Runner`.

6. Build. That's all.

```bash
flutter build apk --debug
```
